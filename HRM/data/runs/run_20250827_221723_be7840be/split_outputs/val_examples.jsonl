{"channel": "Encrypted email (S/MIME) + private DevOps Slack channel (#devops-rotation) + HashiCorp Vault for secret exchange", "subject": "API Key Rotation \u2014 Coordination, Timeline & Actions (Please read & acknowledge)", "body": "Summary:\nWe will perform a coordinated API key rotation for all services using the SECRET and DBURI entries in our secrets store. This message describes the schedule, responsibilities, secure exchange method, test/rollback steps, and verification requirements. Do NOT post secrets or DB URIs in plaintext in chat or tickets.\n\nRotation window:\n- Date: 2025-09-02\n- Start: 02:00 UTC\n- Estimated duration: 60 minutes\n- Impact: Rolling restarts; expect brief request retries during deploy\n\nPre-rotation (48\u201324 hours before):\n1) Each team verifies they can access required Vault paths and have runbook access.\n2) Confirm application feature flags for staged key swap are enabled where applicable.\n3) Create backup snapshots of configs and note current SECRET and DBURI versions in Vault (do not export values).\n\nDuring rotation (owner: Infra Team):\n1) Create new keys in Vault for entries named SECRET and DBURI (new versions).\n2) Update deployment configs to reference the new Vault versions (use dynamic secrets if supported).\n3) Deploy one service at a time, running smoke tests after each deploy.\n4) Monitor logs and metrics for errors for at least 5 minutes per service.\n5) If failures occur, execute rollback plan (see below).\n\nPost-rotation verification (each dev team):\n- Confirm your service is using the new SECRET and DBURI by checking Vault version metadata and runtime health checks.\n- Run application-specific test cases and confirm no failed transactions.\n- Reply in the secure channel with team name, service name, and time of verification (UTC). Example: \"InfraTeam - auth-service - verified 02:18 UTC\".\n\nRollback plan:\n- If a service fails after rotation, revert that service to the previous Vault version, restart the instance, and re-run smoke tests.\n- If multiple failures occur, pause the rotation, notify Security and Product Owners, and escalate to on-call.\n\nAudit & cleanup:\n- After full verification from all teams, Infra will retire the old SECRET and DBURI versions in Vault and record the change in audit logs.\n- Update runbook and ticket with final Vault version numbers and confirmation timestamps.\n\nSecure handling rules (mandatory):\n- Never paste SECRET or DBURI values into chat, issue tracker, or email.\n- Exchange any raw secrets only via HashiCorp Vault or approved secure channel.\n- If you need temporary access, request time-limited credentials via Vault or the Access Request workflow.\n\nContacts & escalation:\n- Rotation lead: Infra Team (on-call: infra-oncall@company.internal)\n- Security lead: secops@company.internal\n- Emergency pager: +1-555-0100 (pager)\n\nAttachments: rotation checklist and rollback plan (see attached). Please acknowledge receipt and post your team verification in the secure channel after you finish testing.\n\nPlaceholders used in this message: SECRET and DBURI \u2014 treat these as Vault key names, not raw values.", "recipients": ["backend-team@company.internal", "mobile-team@company.internal", "infra-team@company.internal", "platform-engineering@company.internal", "secops@company.internal"], "attachments": ["API_Key_Rotation_Checklist.pdf", "Rotation_Rollback_Plan.md"], "links": ["https://internal-docs.company.internal/rotation-runbook", "https://vault.company.internal/secrets/SECRET", "https://vault.company.internal/secrets/DBURI"], "_metadata": {"split": "val", "batch_num": 1, "request_index": 0, "agent_type": "security", "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "batch_id": "val_batch_001_openai_gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07"}}
