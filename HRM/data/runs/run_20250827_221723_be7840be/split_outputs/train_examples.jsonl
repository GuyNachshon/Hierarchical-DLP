{"channel": "email", "subject": "Accounts Payable: Verified Supplier Payment Process Update", "body": "Team,\n\nThis message outlines the updated accounts payable process for executing supplier payments through our verified supplier payment systems. Please follow these steps to ensure timely, secure, and compliant payment processing:\n\n1. Supplier Verification\n- Confirm the supplier is enrolled in the verified payment network before initiating payment.\n- Verify W-9/other tax documentation is on file in the vendor master record.\n\n2. Invoice Submission and Matching\n- Invoices must be submitted via the supplier portal or our AP inbox.\n- Perform three-way matching (invoice, PO, goods/services receipt) where applicable.\n\n3. Approval Workflow\n- Route invoices through the configured approval workflow in the AP system.\n- Approvers must confirm budget availability and expense coding prior to release.\n\n4. Payment Execution\n- Only payments routed through the verified payment system will be executed.\n- Use electronic payment methods (ACH, virtual card) where supported to reduce risk.\n\n5. Controls and Segregation of Duties\n- Payments require dual control for initiation and release. Do not bypass segregation requirements.\n- Record any manual payments with detailed justification and manager sign-off.\n\n6. Exceptions and Escalations\n- If verification fails or there is a dispute, hold payment and notify supplier-relations@company.com.\n- Escalate unresolved issues to AP leadership within 3 business days.\n\n7. Recordkeeping and Audit\n- Maintain copies of invoices, approvals, and payment confirmations in the AP system for audit retention.\n\nIf you have process questions or need access to the verified payment system, open a ticket through the IT service portal or email ap-support@company.com.\n\nThank you,\nAccounts Payable Operations", "recipients": ["ap-team@company.com", "supplier-relations@company.com"], "attachments": [], "links": ["https://intranet.company.com/ap-guidelines", "https://payments.company.com/verification"], "_metadata": {"split": "train", "batch_num": 1, "request_index": 0, "agent_type": "finance", "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "batch_id": "train_batch_001_openai_gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07"}}

Use our official wording \u2014 Legal will advise.\n4) Lock down access: revoke or limit access to the affected documents and audit recent access logs.\n5) Preserve evidence: save the original sent message and any replies for the investigation.\n\nNext steps (24\u201372 hours)\n- Security will run a quick impact assessment and recommend mitigation (e.g., reissue credentials, revoke links).\n- Legal will advise on required notifications if personal or regulated data is involved.\n- We\u2019ll follow up with a short postmortem and action items to prevent recurrence (e.g., gating checklists, training).\n\nIf you\u2019re the person who sent the materials, please reply directly to Security Ops ([NAME]) with a short timeline of what was shared and to whom.\n\nThanks \u2014 I know mistakes happen.
