Submit an access request ticket at the internal access portal and attach your manager approval. (Ticket template attached.)\n2. Once approved, retrieve the DBURI and SECRET from the approved secrets store (e.g., the organization\u2019s Secrets Manager or Vault). Example: retrieve the secrets entry named for the assigned role. Do NOT request DBURI/credentials via email or chat.\n3. Access the database only from approved networks or via the approved bastion/jump host. Ensure MFA is enabled on your account before connecting.\n\nSecurity requirements (must be followed)\n- Use TLS/SSL for all database connections.\n- Access is subject to role-based access control and just-in-time provisioning where possible.\n- Rotate credentials and keys per policy (rotation interval enforced by Secrets Manager).\n- Report any suspicious activity immediately to the Security team.\n\nSupport and contact\n- For access requests: submit a ticket to the Access Management team.\n- For help retrieving secrets from the Secrets Manager: contact secrets-admins@example.com.\n- For urgent security incidents: security@example.com or call the SOC.\n\nAttachments include the access request form and the checklist of required approvals.
