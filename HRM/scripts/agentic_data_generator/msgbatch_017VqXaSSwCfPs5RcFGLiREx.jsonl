This will help drive our Q4 revenue targets.\n- Costs: we are exploring various efficiency measures to offset inflationary pressures, including potential headcount adjustments in certain support functions. We will share more details as plans are finalized.  \n- Incentives: we're adjusting our sales commission structure to prioritize key enterprise customer segments and drive Q4 bookings.\n- Competition: competitor Z has become more aggressive on pricing, so we may need to be responsive with temporary promotions to stay competitive.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.
