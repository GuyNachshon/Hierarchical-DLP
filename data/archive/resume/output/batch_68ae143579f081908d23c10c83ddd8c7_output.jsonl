Store artifacts in approved encrypted repositories only.\\n- Vendor due diligence: Confirm the vendor\u2019s PCI DSS scope, signed DPA, key management practices, and incident notification timelines before sending any data with PAN.\\n- Logging and DLP: Classify files as Confidential \u2013 Cardholder Data.

All media or competitor contacts are routed to Legal/Comms; do not confirm any details about the incident.\\n\\nNDA enforcement and legal options:\\n- Inventory all current NDAs with employees, contractors, consultants, and vendors who accessed the strategy materials (use attached template).\\n- Send immediate NDA reminder and preservation notices to those counterparties under counsel\u2019s signature; require confirmation of compliance and disclosure of any onward sharing.\\n- Evaluate breach-of-NDA, trade secret misappropriation (DTSA/UTSA), breach of duty/loyalty, and related claims. Prepare draft cease-and-desist letters and, if warranted, a motion for temporary restraining order and expedited discovery.\\n- Engage outside counsel to deliver preservation letters to identified competitors without disclosing the substance of our strategy.\\n\\nInterviews and documentation:\\n- Conduct targeted custodian interviews under Upjohn warnings; document via counsel-directed memoranda and maintain chain of custody for any collected devices.\\n- HR to assess personnel implications and ensure no retaliation against whistleblowers.\\n\\nGovernance and reporting:\\n- Prepare a privileged update for the Board. Regulatory notifications are not anticipated based on current scope, but reassess promptly if personal data or regulated information is identified in the leaked set.\\n\\nNext steps and owners:\\n- CISO/IT: complete the containment actions above and confirm in the Secure Matter Room by 3:00 PM today.\\n- Legal/Outside Counsel: circulate draft letters, litigation hold, and TRO materials for review in the Secure Matter Room by COB.\\n- All recipients: acknowledge this notice in the Secure Matter Room within 1 hour.\\n\\nDo not reply-all to this EMAIL.

The attached draft term sheet is for discussion purposes only and non\u2011binding.\\n\\n3) Conflicts and engagement: Please confirm conflicts are cleared and that your engagement terms remain in effect for this matter.\\n\\n4) Workplan and budget: Propose a phased workplan (NDA, counterparty diligence, drafting/markup, negotiation) and provide a rough budget range for Phase 1 (through NDA execution and initial scoping), with key assumptions. Please do not proceed beyond Phase 1 without written approval.\\n\\n5) Communications and security: Use the secure folder link below for document exchange.

Note: Do not share credentials or connection endpoints in email or chat.\\n\\n1) Identity and approvals\\n- Validate the requester\u2019s identity via SSO with MFA and confirm the approval in the ticketing system.\\n- Ensure the business justification and data sensitivity classification are recorded in the ticket.\\n\\n2) Least-privilege role assignment\\n- Assign the minimum role required (e.g., read-only/reporting). Avoid admin roles unless explicitly approved by Security and the Data Owner.\\n- Set time-bounded access with an expiry date; require re-approval for extensions.\\n\\n3) Credential and endpoint delivery (secure channel only)\\n- Do not send any credentials or connection endpoints here. Provision credentials and the connection information via the enterprise secrets vault and notify the requester to retrieve them there.\\n- Enforce MFA on the vault item, and restrict visibility to the approved individual(s) only.\\n- If VPN or bastion access is required, grant it separately and time-bound it as well.\\n\\n4) Monitoring and audit\\n- Log all changes in the ticket, including assigned role, scope, and expiry.\\n- Verify that database audit logging is enabled for the new account and that alerts are configured for anomalous use.\\n- Schedule a follow-up review before expiry; remove access immediately upon role change or completion of the project.\\n\\nReminders\\n- Never paste endpoints, connection strings, or secrets into email, chat, or documents without access controls.\\n- If a correction is needed, rotate the credentials in the vault and update the ticket with a brief incident note.\\n\\nIf you need help with vault permissions or role mapping, contact the DB Admins or Security.\\n\\nThanks,\\nSecurity Engineering\",\"recipients\":[\"approved.user@company.com\",\"db-admins@company.com\",\"security@company.com\"],\"attachments\":[],\"links\":[\"https://intranet.company.com/security/db-access-policy\",\"https://intranet.company.com/security/secrets-vault/how-to\",\"https://intranet.company.com/security/least-privilege-standards\",\"https://intranet.company.com/security/db-connection-hardening\"]}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 149, "completion_tokens": 1658, "total_tokens": 1807, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1152, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}
