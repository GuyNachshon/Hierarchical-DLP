If any copies cannot be deleted, list locations.\n3) Audit logs: Security/IT should pull access logs for the file, including timestamps, user IDs, and IP addresses, and provide a preliminary access report.\n4) Remediation for exposed fields: Replace or mask sensitive values in the master file. Example masking format for records already captured in logs or screenshots: [REDACTED: SSN], [REDACTED: PHONE]. Do NOT circulate unmasked copies outside authorized roles.\n5) Notify affected individuals if required by policy/regulation (Compliance to advise). Determine whether notification/credit monitoring is needed based on scope.\n6) Permissions & process change: Finance and IT must review and update access controls and the reconciliation workflow to enforce least privilege and automated masking/encryption for SSN/PHONE fields going forward.\n7) Incident report: Complete the internal incident report form and provide updates to InfoSec and Compliance.\n\nRequested deliverables within 24 hours:\n- Confirmation that access was revoked (IT)\n- List of recipients who received the file and confirmation of deletion (Finance & recipients)\n- Preliminary access log export (Security/IT)\n- Recommended next steps for notification and remediation plan (Compliance)\n\nPoint of contact:\n- InfoSec Incident Response: infosec-incident@company.com\n- IT Security lead: it-security@company.com\n\nNotes:\n- Do NOT share the unmasked file or any SSN/PHONE values by email or chat.

{"channel": "email", "subject": "Accounts Payable: Processing Payments via Verified Supplier Payment Systems", "body": "Team,\n\nWhen processing supplier invoices through verified payment systems, follow these mandatory controls to prevent fraud and protect sensitive payment data (e.g., PANs and phone numbers):\n\n1. Verify supplier identity before adding or changing payment details\n   - Use the supplier's known, pre-approved contact from our vendor master file or corporate directory. Do not rely solely on contact details provided on invoices.\n   - Confirm any changes out-of-band using an independently validated contact method (e.g., corporate email from vendor master record or a verified portal), not the phone number listed on the invoice.\n\n2. Never transmit PANs or full card numbers via email or unencrypted channels\n   - Use tokenization or the supplier's secure payment portal for card payments.\n   - If PANs must be processed, ensure systems and vendors are PCI-DSS compliant and that data is handled only within approved, encrypted platforms.\n\n3. Bank account and payment-method changes\n   - Require a supplier change request form plus secondary approval from AP management before updating payment instructions.\n   - Perform a small-value test transaction where applicable, then confirm receipt via the pre-approved vendor contact.\n\n4. Invoice validation and segregation of duties\n   - Match invoices to approved purchase orders and receiving records.\n   - Ensure different staff perform invoice entry, approval, and payment execution.\n\n5. Logging and monitoring\n   - Record all verification steps in the AP system and retain evidence of approvals and confirmations.\n   - Escalate anomalies (unexpected bank detail changes, rush payment requests, or mismatched vendor information) to Fraud & Compliance immediately.\n\n6. Handling phone numbers and contact data\n   - Treat supplier phone numbers as sensitive contact data. Do not post or transmit them in public or unsecured channels. Use internal directories or vendor master records for confirmations.\n\nIf you need the supplier verification checklist or guidance on tokenization providers, refer to the attached checklist and the AP policy on the intranet.

{"channel": "email", "subject": "Accounts Payable: Verified Supplier Payment System Procedures", "body": "Overview:\nThis message summarizes the standard process and controls for processing supplier payments through verified payment systems. The goal is to ensure timely, accurate payments while maintaining strong controls to protect sensitive financial data.\n\nKey Controls and Steps:\n- Vendor Onboarding: Collect validated vendor contact and bank details via a secure vendor portal. Verify identity using business registration documents and bank account confirmation (e.g., micro\u2011deposit verification or bank letter). Do NOT collect or store full PANs or SSNs in AP systems.\n- Payment Methods: Use approved payment rails (ACH, wire, virtual card) through verified/PCI\u2011compliant payment processors. Prefer tokenized payment instruments where supported to avoid storing PANs.\n- Data Handling: Mask any sensitive account identifiers in internal systems. Store only the minimum required data and use encryption at rest and in transit. Ensure systems handling card data are PCI\u2011DSS compliant.\n- Approvals and Segregation of Duties: Require multi\u2011level invoice and payment approvals. Segregate duties between invoice entry, approval, payment execution, and reconciliation roles.\n- Reconciliation and Monitoring: Perform daily/weekly reconciliations between the AP ledger and bank/payment processor statements. Investigate and document exceptions promptly.\n- Audit Trail & Record Retention: Maintain a clear, time\u2011stamped audit trail for onboarding, approvals, payment execution, and reconciliations. Retain records according to company policy and applicable regulations.\n- Exception Handling & Fraud Prevention: Use positive pay, anomaly detection, and confirmation calls for any changes to vendor banking details. Implement dual confirmation for high\u2011value payment changes.\n- Compliance: Follow applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., tax reporting obligations). If you require tax forms from vendors, direct them to submit through the secure vendor portal; do not accept SSNs by email.\n\nAction Items:\n- AP teams: Continue using the verified supplier payment system and ensure all new vendors are onboarded via the portal.\n- Finance leads: Review and confirm that payment processors and vendor data handling procedures remain PCI\u2011compliant and that bank account verification processes are enforced.\n- Questions or exceptions: Contact the AP Controls team for guidance before executing non\u2011standard payments.\n\nContact:\nAP Controls Team (ap-controls@company.com)\nFinance Controller (finance-controller@company.com)\n\nNotes: This communication intentionally omits any full PANs, SSNs, or other confidential numeric identifiers.
