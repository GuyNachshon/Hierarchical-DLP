Target internal review within one week (date to be confirmed).\n\n- Discovery plan: adopt a phased approach \u2014 (1) limited core document production, (2) focused written discovery, (3) targeted depositions. Coordinate custodial searches and ESI protocols now to avoid delay. Privilege logs should be prepared concurrently.\n\n- Depositions: identify four priority witnesses (fact witnesses and a corporate Rule 30(b)(6) witness). Prepare deposition outlines and schedule availability with opposing counsel. Consider sequencing depositions to support briefing on key issues.\n\n- Experts & evidence: determine whether we need a technical expert and a damages expert. If so, begin vetting and engagement letters this month to meet expert disclosure windows.\n\n- Settlement posture: develop a narrow settlement position as leverage for discovery and motion practice. Confirm BATNA and settlement authority before mediation discussions.\n\n- Deadlines & responsibilities: I will circulate a draft timeline and assign responsibilities.

Do NOT paste the key into tickets or chat.\n   - Run integration tests in staging using the new key.\n   - Notify monitoring and on-call teams and ensure runbook is available.\n\n2) Rotation (during window)\n   - Put consumers into a brief maintenance mode if required.\n   - Deploy configuration that points consumers to the new secret reference.\n   - Verify connections to the DBURI (use environment that reads secret from the secrets manager) and validate application health checks.\n\n3) Validation & monitoring (immediate after)\n   - Run smoke tests and sanity checks against the service endpoints.\n   - Monitor logs and error rates for at least 30 minutes.\n   - Confirm with each team that their service is healthy.\n\n4) Rollback plan\n   - If issues occur, restore the prior secret reference via the secrets manager and redeploy the previous configuration.\n   - Follow the runbook rollback procedure and escalate to on-call if rollback fails.\n\nSecure delivery instructions (MANDATORY):\n- Never paste actual DBURI or SECRET values in email, chat, or ticket descriptions.\n- To share a new secret value, use one of the following approved secure channels only:\n   \u2022 Store secret in Vault/Secrets Manager and grant access to the team roles.\n   \u2022 Send PGP-encrypted email to the recipient\u2019s verified key if immediate handover is required.\n   \u2022 Use the approved ephemeral secure-sharing tool (see runbook link below) for one-time secrets.\n\nWhat I need from each team by EOD today:\n- Confirm availability for the proposed window or propose an alternate time.\n- Confirm who will perform the post-rotation verification and monitoring for your service (name + secure contact).\n\nContacts & escalation:\n- Rotation owner: Platform Security (ops-security@company.com) \u2014 encrypted channel only for secrets.\n- On-call: Pager duty (use internal PagerDuty link in runbook).\n\nAttachments: rotation runbook and checklist (no secrets included).
