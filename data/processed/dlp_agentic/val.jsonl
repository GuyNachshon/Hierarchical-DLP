Confirm contact and banking details using the portal; do not accept payment details delivered by unverified email or phone.\n\n2) Protect sensitive identifiers: Do not record or store sensitive personal identifiers or unmasked card numbers in payment memos, spreadsheets, or ticketing comments.

Large or out-of-pattern payments require additional authorization from Finance Compliance.\n\n5) Exception handling: Submit exceptions through the AP exception ticketing process. Do not bypass controls to expedite payment; escalate any suspected fraud to Vendor Management and Security immediately.\n\n6) Reconciliation and audit trail: Reconcile daily and keep the immutable audit trail from the verified system as the record of payment. Save only non-sensitive reference IDs in local reports.\n\nIf you have questions about a vendor record, suspected fraudulent details, or need a supplier verification, contact Vendor Management or Finance Compliance before initiating payment.\n\nThanks,\nAccounts Payable", "recipients": ["ap-team@company.com", "vendor-management@company.com", "finance-compliance@company.com"], "attachments": [], "links": ["https://intranet.company.com/ap/verified-suppliers", "https://intranet.company.com/security/payment-guidelines"]}

{"channel": "email", "subject": "Accounts Payable: Processing Payments via Verified Supplier Payment Systems \u2014 SSN & PAN Handling", "body": "Summary:\nFollow these mandatory controls when processing supplier payments through verified supplier payment systems. The goal is secure, auditable payments while minimizing exposure of sensitive identifiers (SSN, PAN).\n\nMandatory steps:\n1) Use only approved/verified supplier payment channels (vendor portal, bank-hosted payment platforms, or our AP system integrations). Do not use ad-hoc email, chat, or consumer file-sharing services for payment data.\n2) Never transmit full SSN or full PAN via email or unencrypted attachments. If an identifier is required for verification, use tokenization, masking (display only last 4 digits), or a secure vault. Retain only what is permitted by policy and law.\n3) Follow PCI DSS and internal policy for PANs: store only truncated PANs where necessary, ensure tokenization or card vaulting, and use approved processors for card payments.\n4) For SSNs: minimize collection, use hashed/tokenized values if required, and restrict access to authorized personnel only. Store SSNs only in approved HR/Payroll systems when legally required \u2014 do not store in AP records.\n5) Verify supplier banking and contact details using a multi-factor verification process (call-back to a known corporate contact, confirm via vendor portal, or check prior validated invoices). Document verification in the vendor record.\n6) Maintain the three-way match (PO, invoice, receipt) and require approval workflows before release of funds. Include an AP supervisor or manager sign-off for high-value transfers.\n7) Use encrypted transfer methods (SFTP, secure APIs, or bank-hosted file exchange) when sending remittance files.

There is currently no evidence of misuse.\n- However, you should remain alert for unusual or unexpected contacts. Scammers sometimes use names and phone numbers to craft convincing social-engineering attempts.\n\nRecommended actions for employees:\n1) Monitor: Watch for suspicious calls, texts, or emails asking for additional personal information or financial details. Do not provide personal data in response to unsolicited requests.\n2) Verify: If you receive a call or message claiming to be from HR or our benefits vendor, independently verify by contacting HR at hr-incident@acme-corp.com or by calling [PHONE]. Do not use contact details provided in the suspicious message.\n3) Report: Immediately report any suspicious communications or suspected misuse to hr-incident@acme-corp.com and to our security team at security@acme-corp.com.\n\nWhat we will do next:\n- Complete the incident investigation and share final findings and any additional recommended steps.\n- Implement additional checks in the sending process and provide supplementary staff training on handling sensitive HR data.\n- Offer targeted support if we identify anyone at elevated risk as a result of this incident.\n\nIf you have questions or believe your information has been misused, contact HR at hr-incident@acme-corp.com or call [PHONE].

If static credentials are used, verify usage justification and compensating controls.\n5) Auditing & Monitoring\n   - Ensure audit logging is enabled for authentication and access events and logs are retained per retention policy.\n6) Incident & Recovery\n   - Confirm playbook exists for credential compromise (rotate SECRET, revoke sessions, update DBURI if applicable).\n\nHow to retrieve sensitive values:\n- Use the internal secrets manager (e.g., Vault path: secret/data/prod/db) or the company-approved secrets console.
