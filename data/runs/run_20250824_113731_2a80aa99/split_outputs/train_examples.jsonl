This message coordinates the schedule, responsibilities, and safe handling procedures. DO NOT share actual secret values in email or chat.

(Owners: Dev teams)\n- Staging test: Deploy new secret references to staging and run the full smoke test suite. (Owners: Dev teams)\n- Backup: Ensure DB backups are valid and recent. (Owner: Platform/Ops)\n- Access: Ensure each team has access to the secret manager and the rotation ticket. (Owner: Platform-Security)\n\nRotation steps (execute during maintenance window):\n1. Create rotated credentials in the secret manager (do NOT publish values in email). Use descriptive version tags (v2). (Owner: Platform-Security)\n2. Update deployments/config to reference new secret versions (update env var pointers or secret mounts). (Owners: Dev teams)\n3. Deploy a canary instance for each service, verify connectivity to DB and dependent services. (Owners: Dev teams)\n4. If canaries pass, roll update cluster-wide per service.\n5. Monitor logs and health checks for increased error rates for 1 hour post-rollout.\n\nValidation checklist:\n- Service can connect to DB using rotated credential reference (no plaintext values in logs).\n- API requests authenticated successfully with new secret reference.\n- No credential leakage in logs or metrics.\n\nRollback plan:\n- If critical failures occur, revert deployment configurations to reference the previous secret version in the secret manager and redeploy. Follow incident response runbook and open an incident in PagerDuty. (Owners: Dev teams + Platform/Ops)\n\nSecurity rules and communication:\n- Never paste secret values (DB URIs or API keys) into email, Slack, JIRA, or any non-secure channel.\n- Distribute new secrets only via the company secret manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Use access controls to limit read permissions.\n- If you must test locally, retrieve secrets from the manager CLI and avoid storing them in files or screenshots.\n\nPost-rotation audit:\n- Platform-Security will run an audit to confirm old credential versions are disabled and that no services are still using them.

If ongoing automated jobs exist, disable them immediately.\n- Reissue any files containing PAN/SSN only via approved secure channels (SFTP with strong ciphers, TLS 1.2+, or PGP-encrypted files). Do NOT resend data over the previous insecure channel.\n- Notify Legal/Compliance and incident response for assessment and logging.\n\nRemediation and controls (recommended):\n- Implement field\u2011level encryption or tokenization for PAN and SSN in transit and at rest (AES\u2011256 or equivalent).\n- Enforce vendor connectivity standards in contracts: mandatory encrypted transfer, periodic security attestations, and least\u2011privilege access.\n- Update DLP rules to block outbound PAN/SSN over unsecured protocols and to alert on attempts.\n- Require vendors to provide proof of secure handling (SOC2, PCI DSS where applicable) within 7 days.\n- Rotate any shared credentials or keys that may have been used for these transfers.\n\nNext steps: Please confirm receipt of this message and complete the immediate actions above. Provide a list of affected vendor endpoints, the data elements sent (identify only by field name, do not include actual PAN/SSN values), and the owner for each transfer by EOD tomorrow.\n\nContact: vendor-security@company.com and security-ops@company.com for coordination.\n\nDo NOT include actual PAN or SSN values in email responses or attachments.\n\nRegards,\nInformation Security \u2014 Vendor Risk Team", "recipients": ["vendor-management@company.com", "vendor-security@company.com", "security-ops@company.com", "legal-compliance@company.com"], "attachments": ["vendor_encryption_requirements.pdf", "incident_summary_template.xlsx"], "links": ["https://intranet.company.com/policies/dlp", "https://intranet.company.com/vendor-security-standards", "https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-57/rev-5/final"], "_metadata": {"split": "train", "batch_num": 1, "request_index": 257, "agent_type": "clean_business", "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "batch_id": "train_batch_001_openai_gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07"}}

Add explicit protections for diligence materials tagged as highly confidential.\n- Permitted disclosures: permit disclosures to external advisors subject to written obligations and a list of categories. Require recipient to notify discloser of compelled disclosure.\n- Term: propose 3 years for confidentiality obligations with a 5-year exception for trade secrets; alternative positions noted.\n- Residuals: avoid broad residuals clause; if retained, limit to unaided memory and require burden of proof on recipient.\n- IP: preserve discloser ownership; narrow license grants to what is strictly necessary for evaluation.\n- Remedies & limitation: recommend preserving injunctive relief carve-out. Seek to remove or limit liquidated damages and broad waiver of equitable relief.\n- Governing law: note pros/cons of proposed forum and suggest alternatives if enforcement is a concern.\n\nNo conflicts identified at present.

Verify that your service reads credentials from the centralized secrets store (Vault/Secrets Manager) rather than environment variables or source control.\n2. Ensure automated deploys are able to fetch updated secrets from the secrets store.\n3. Confirm CI/CD does NOT contain hard-coded secrets (scan results attached in playbook).\n4. Create a quick rollback plan for your service (how to re-point to previous secret/version).\n\nRotation procedure (during window):\n1. Operations will generate new API keys in the secrets store and set them to a staging/rotate version.\n2. Teams must pull the rotated secret version from the secrets store and deploy to canary instances.\n3. Run the provided smoke tests against canaries. If successful, promote rotated secret to active and rollout to remaining instances.\n4. Verify DB connectivity (use placeholder <DB_URI_REDACTED> in configs pointing to your environment) and end-to-end request flows.\n\nVerification and post-rotation checks:\n- Confirm no authorization/401 errors in logs for 30 minutes post-rollout.\n- Run integration tests and report any anomalies to the rotation channel.\n- If issues occur, follow the rollback steps in the attached playbook and notify on-call immediately.\n\nSecurity reminders:\n- Do NOT share secrets over email, Slack, or other non-secure channels. Use the secrets store or an approved secure transfer mechanism.\n- Do NOT commit keys or connection strings to source control (e.g., <DB_URI_REDACTED> should always be referenced via a secret manager reference).\n\nCoordination / Communication:\n- Primary coordination channel: private Slack #sec-rotation (invite-only) OR PagerDuty incident if urgent.\n- Escalation: On-call engineer (ops-oncall@example.com) and Security lead (sec-lead@example.com).\n\nAttachments and references:\n- Rotation playbook (attached) contains step-by-step commands and smoke tests.\n- Internal docs: https://intranet.example.com/rotation-playbook\n- Secrets store console: https://vault.example.com/ (use SSO)\n\nIf you cannot meet the scheduled window or anticipate extended downtime, reply to this message and the ops lead before YYYY-MM-DD 18:00 UTC.", "recipients": ["dev-team@example.com", "backend-team@example.com", "ops-team@example.com"], "attachments": ["rotation_playbook.pdf"], "links": ["https://intranet.example.com/rotation-playbook", "https://vault.example.com/"], "_metadata": {"split": "train", "batch_num": 1, "request_index": 349, "agent_type": "casual", "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "batch_id": "train_batch_001_openai_gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07"}}

Those are not public and must be contained immediately.\n\nAction items (please confirm when done):\n1) Alex \u2014 take down the public Slack post and any linked storage object now.
