Share only the vault path or link to the secret entry (for example: \"<connection-string-vault-path>\" or \"<vault-secret-entry-path>\").\n5. Access control: require access through the approved bastion/jump host or VPN, enforce MFA, and restrict source IPs as appropriate.\n6. Logging and monitoring: enable audit logging for all access, configure alerts for anomalous queries or privilege escalations, and record the provisioning action in the ticket.\n7. Rotation and review: schedule automatic rotation for any long-lived credentials and perform periodic access reviews (e.g., quarterly). Revoke access immediately upon role change or termination.\n8.

Please update the ticket status by end of day Thursday.\n- QA: Complete the expanded regression suite and share any failing cases in the QA channel.\n- Product: Review and sign off on the updated acceptance criteria for the search improvements by the next check-in.\n\nMilestones / Meetings:\n- Demo to stakeholders: Tentatively scheduled for next Wednesday.

Resolve any failures before proceeding.\n3) During the production window, update production configuration to reference the new secret version via the Secrets Manager (do not paste secret values into config files).\n4) Deploy the update through the standard controlled rollout (canary -> 50% -> full) and monitor.\n5) After successful rollout and verification, rotate or revoke the old key according to the provider policy.\n\nVerification & success criteria:\n- All smoke tests pass in production after rollout.\n- No authentication errors above baseline across the next 30 minutes (monitoring dashboard link below).\n- No active incidents from downstream services (confirm via secure channel).\n\nRollback plan:\n- If authentication errors exceed the threshold or critical user flows fail, revert to the previous Secrets Manager version and run a redeploy of the prior configuration.\n- Notify the secure channel and open an incident if rollback is required. Maintain the old key for emergency reactivation per the rollback runbook.\n\nCommunication channels:\n- Primary coordination: private channel #api-rotation (Company Secure Chat).\n- Backup: Secure Email to sre-oncall@example.com and platform-team@example.com.\n- Create/attach the ticket ID to any messages.\n\nAction items for recipients:\n- Confirm receipt in the private channel and list any blockers within 2 hours.\n- Complete pre-rotation checklist items for your services and confirm readiness by 2025-09-01 18:00 UTC.\n- After your service is updated, post completion time, deployment artifact ID, and verification results to the private channel and the ticket.\n\nContacts:\n- SRE on-call: sre-oncall@example.com\n- Platform lead: platform-team@example.com\n\nNotes:\n- Never transmit secret values in email, public Slack, or ticket comments.

This introduces elevated risk for both PCI and privacy compliance and must be remediated immediately.\n\nImmediate actions required (within 24 hours):\n- Stop all ongoing transmissions that include PAN or SSN over any channel that is not explicitly approved and encrypted (do not use plain FTP, unencrypted email, or web forms without TLS).\n- Each vendor lead must confirm by EOD which vendors received PAN or SSN and which channels were used (email, FTP, SFTP, API, portal).\n- Apply a temporary mitigation: move data transfer to an approved secure channel (SFTP/FTPS over TLS 1.2+, HTTPS with strong ciphers, AS2) or suspend the transfer until a secure method is in place.\n\nTechnical and compliance requirements (required in remediation plan within 14 days):\n- For PAN: ensure all transfers meet PCI DSS requirements. Use end-to-end encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+), tokenization or truncation where possible, and encryption at rest on vendor systems.\n- For SSN: minimize transmission of full SSNs. Where SSNs are required, use strong transport encryption (TLS 1.2+), apply access controls, and encrypt data at rest. Consider hashing or tokenization to avoid storing clear-text SSNs.\n- Implement mutual authentication and rotate credentials/keys immediately for affected connections. Replace any shared clear-text credentials.\n- Require vendors to provide proof of their controls (attestation, SOC 2 / PCI Attestation of Compliance, or equivalent) and sign/update Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) or Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) as applicable.\n\nValidation and timeline:\n- 24 hours: vendor list and channels impacted, temporary mitigation confirmation.\n- 72 hours: temporary secure channel implemented or transfers suspended.\n- 14 days: submit a remediation plan with milestones and vendor commitments.\n- 90 days: full remediation or documented exception approved by Security and Compliance.\n\nNext steps and support:\n- Vendor Management and Procurement: compile and send the vendor list and contracts to Security and Compliance.\n- IT Security: run an audit of transfer endpoints, rotate credentials/keys, and configure approved secure transfer mechanisms.\n- Compliance/Privacy: review required contract language and regulatory obligations for PCI/HIPAA applicable to PAN/SSN.\n\nDo not communicate with external parties or customers about this incident without prior approval from Legal and Compliance.

Confirm you have access to the organization-approved secret manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) and your team\u2019s secret scope.\n2. Verify automated deployment pipelines can fetch updated secrets from the secret manager without manual intervention.\n3. Ensure health checks, integration tests, and rollback procedures are ready.\n4.

Generate a new credential pair via the secret manager or database admin console \u2014 do NOT paste or share the value in chat/email.\n3. Update the secret entry in the secret manager with the new values. Use the secret manager\u2019s versioning API so previous versions remain available.\n4. Trigger your deployment pipeline to pick up the new secret from the secret manager.\n5. Run smoke tests and integration tests targeting read/write operations.\n6. Confirm service health and increased traffic handling where applicable.\n\nVerification and monitoring:\n- Check logs for authentication errors, connection failures, or retries immediately after rotation.\n- Run agreed acceptance tests within 15 minutes of deployment.\n- Report status (PASS/FAIL) in the secure coordination channel within your window.\n\nRollback plan:\n- If critical failures occur, restore the previous secret version in the secret manager and redeploy the service to that version.\n- Notify the on-call DBA and the rotation coordinator immediately and provide failure diagnostics in the secure channel.\n\nSecurity and handling of sensitive spans (DBURI, SECRET):\n- Never include DBURI or SECRET values in emails, tickets, or public chat.\n- All secrets must be written/updated only via the approved secret manager.\n- If a secret is accidentally exposed, follow the incident response runbook immediately and rotate the exposed secret.\n\nCoordination and contacts:\n- Primary coordinator: Security Ops (sec-ops@example.com)\n- DBA on-call: dba-oncall@example.com\n- Use the secure coordination channel: company-approved encrypted channel (e.g., SecureOps Slack channel #secure-rotations or the enterprise Signal group).

{"channel": "email", "subject": "Accounts Payable: Updated Process for Verified Supplier Payment Systems", "body": "Team,\n\nWe are implementing an updated accounts payable process that uses only verified supplier payment systems. Please follow these steps when submitting invoices or onboarding suppliers:\n\n1. Invoice submission: Submit invoices through the AP portal with the following fields: invoice number, invoice date, PO number (if applicable), supplier legal name, supplier tax ID (e.g., EIN), invoice amount, and remittance instructions. Do NOT include any individual's Social Security Number (SSN) or personal phone numbers on invoices or in attachments.\n\n2. Supplier verification: All supplier bank and payment details will be verified through our approved vendor verification service. The AP team will not process payments to unverified accounts.\n\n3. Approval workflow: Invoices must include the coded GL account and approver name and be approved in the AP system before the payment batch cutoff. Late approvals will be processed in the next scheduled run.\n\n4. Payment timing: Regular payment runs occur on the 1st and 15th of each month (or the next business day). Emergency or off-cycle payments require manager approval and supporting justification.\n\n5.
