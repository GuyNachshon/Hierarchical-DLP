Do not use unsecured channels (personal email, SMS, WhatsApp, regular unencrypted email, or public chat) to transmit confidential client details or documents.\n\nRequired immediate actions:\n- Stop: Do not include client identifiers or substantive privileged details in subject lines or body text on unsecured channels.\n- Use secure channels only: firm secure client portal, encrypted email (S/MIME or PGP), or approved secure file-share. See links below.\n- Limit recipients: Share privileged information only with persons who have a need to know and within the firm\u2019s approved systems.\n\nIf privileged information has already been sent via an unsecured channel:\n1) Attempt an immediate recall if the platform supports it.\n2) Notify IT Security and Compliance immediately so they can assess exposure and advise remediation.\n3) Inform the client promptly about the potential exposure and the steps we are taking. Obtain any required consents or instructions before further action.\n4) Re-send the material only via an approved secure channel and keep a record of all actions taken.\n\nBest practices for secure transfers:\n- Use the firm secure portal for document exchange and request clients to upload directly.\n- Encrypt email end-to-end when portal use is not possible (use S/MIME or PGP) and verify recipient encryption keys before sending.\n- Password-protect attachments and transmit the password via a separate secure channel (e.g., phone call) only when permitted by firm policy.\n- Redact unnecessary identifiers from documents and avoid using the client\u2019s full name or email in filenames and subject lines.\n\nSuggested client instruction (copy/paste):\n\"For your security, please upload any confidential documents to our secure client portal at the link provided, rather than emailing attachments.

Do NOT place DBURI or SECRET values in this email or any unencrypted chat. Retrieve or update these values only via the approved secrets manager/vault and in the secure channel agreed below.\n\nGoals:\n- Rotate API keys and any dependent secrets safely with minimal service disruption.\n- Verify all services successfully pick up new credentials.\n- Provide an auditable rollout and safe rollback path.\n\nPre-rotation checklist (owners must complete before the window):\n1) Confirm owners and on-call contacts are available. List of responsible people is in recipients.\n2) Ensure recent backups exist for dependent systems and configurations.\n3) Verify that health checks and smoke-test scripts are up-to-date.\n4) Ensure CI/CD jobs that read secrets are configured to fetch from the vault (do not hardcode DBURI/SECRET).\n5) Post credentials to the vault only via the approved interfaces (API/UI) \u2014 do not share values via email or public chat.\n\nRotation steps (execute in order):\n1) Announce start of the rotation in the secure channel and set status to \"in-progress.\" Do not include any secret values in the announcement.\n2) Put services into a safe state if required (maintenance mode or drain connections).\n3) Rotate the credential in the secrets manager (store the new SECRET, and update DBURI if it contains credential components) according to the vault playbook.\n4) Trigger configuration reloads or deploy new configuration that references the new vault secret name/version. Confirm that services fetch the secret from the vault at startup or via the configured refresh mechanism.\n5) Run automated smoke tests and targeted integration tests.\n6) Monitor logs, error rates, latency, and key metrics for at least the agreed observation period.\n\nVerification:\n- Each service owner must report success in the secure channel with the following non-sensitive confirmations:\n  * Service X restarted and healthy (yes/no)\n  * Smoke tests passed (yes/no)\n  * Errors observed (brief description, no secret data)\n- Collect and store rotation audit logs from the secrets manager (who/when/what changed).\n\nRollback plan:\n- If critical failures occur, revert to the previous secret version in the vault and restart services that use it.\n- Document the reason and the remediation steps taken after rollback.\n\nSecurity rules & handling of sensitive spans:\n- DBURI and SECRET are sensitive spans. Never paste their values into email, tickets, or non-secure chat.\n- Use vault versioning and the vault UI/API to rotate and retrieve values.\n- Access to secrets is logged; coordinate any emergency manual sharing through an approved, encrypted channel only.\n\nCommunication & escalation:\n- Primary coordination channel: secure chat room (link below). Use that room to post status updates (start, progress, success, rollback).\n- Escalation: if service outage persists beyond the agreed observation period, escalate to on-call infra and security (recipients include security@example.com).\n\nPost-rotation:\n- Owners confirm services stable for the agreed monitoring period and close the rotation in the secure channel.\n- Attach audit logs and post-mortem notes to the internal rotation ticket (no secret values included).\n\nContacts:\n- Infra ops: infra-ops@example.com\n- Security: security@example.com\n- SRE on-call: sre-oncall@example.com\n\nNotes:\n- If you need to share a DBURI or SECRET for troubleshooting, create a temporary, time-limited secret in the vault and share the vault reference only. Do NOT share raw values.\n- If you need help executing any step, post in the secure chat channel or contact the on-call SRE.\n", "recipients": ["dev-team-backend@example.com", "dev-team-frontend@example.com", "infra-ops@example.com", "security@example.com"], "attachments": ["api-key-rotation-checklist.pdf", "post-rotation-validation-script.sh"], "links": ["https://intranet.example.com/docs/key-rotation", "https://vault.example.com/docs", "https://chat.example.com/secure-channel-for-rotation"], "_metadata": {"split": "test", "batch_num": 1, "request_index": 122, "agent_type": "security", "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "batch_id": "test_batch_001_openai_gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07"}}

Do NOT send payment files containing full PANs or SSNs over standard email.\n- Data handling: Use tokenized identifiers or masked values (e.g., last 4 digits only) when referencing accounts in email. Full PANs and SSNs will be exchanged only within encrypted files or token systems in compliance with PCI DSS and applicable privacy regulations.\n- File formats and specs: We will use NACHA/ACH (or ISO 20022 where applicable). Refer to the attached file_specifications_v2.pdf for field-level requirements and accepted encryption standards (PGP/TLS).\n- Encryption: All outbound files must be PGP-encrypted or transmitted over TLS/SFTP with host verification. Passwords/keys must not be sent in the body of an email; use our pre-agreed key exchange process.\n- Schedule and cutoffs: Regular processing cycle runs daily with a cutoff at 18:00 ET. A test transaction is scheduled for 2025-09-01; please confirm you can receive and process that test.\n- Reconciliation: We will provide daily reconciliation reports. If you require additional reporting fields, specify them by reply so we can include them in the next file variant.\n- Escalation and contacts: For operational issues use ops@ourcompany.com (primary) and payments-support@bankpartner.com (bank). For security incidents, notify security@ourcompany.com immediately and follow incident response procedures.\n\nNext steps:\n1) Confirm receipt of this message and acceptance of the transmission/encryption approach.\n2) Confirm ability to process the test transaction on 2025-09-01.\n3) Advise any required changes to file specs by 2025-08-28.\n\nNotes:\n- Under no circumstances should full PANs or SSNs be included in unencrypted email or attachments.\n- If you need a mapping from tokens to PANs or SSNs for reconciliation, we will provide that through our secure token vault integration only.\n\nThank you,\nPayments Operations", "recipients": ["ops@bankpartner.com", "payments@merchant.com", "pm@ourcompany.com"], "attachments": ["payment_schedule_Q3.csv", "file_specifications_v2.pdf"], "links": ["https://secure.payments-portal.example.com", "sftp://sftp.bankpartner.example.com/inbound"], "_metadata": {"split": "test", "batch_num": 1, "request_index": 177, "agent_type": "finance", "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "batch_id": "test_batch_001_openai_gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07"}}

Users retrieve secrets via the approved client/UI and must authenticate with MFA.\n6) Enable audit logging for the account and the secrets access. Monitor usage and alert on anomalies.\n7) Enforce credential rotation policy (e.g., rotate every 90 days or on role change/termination).

Samples in the transfer logs show masked identifiers (e.g., PAN: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234, SSN: XXX-XX-6789) that were transmitted in cleartext or via unencrypted channels.\n\nImmediate actions (required):\n1) STOP: Suspend any non\u2011encrypted transfers of files or API calls containing PAN or SSN within 4 hours. If you are unsure whether a transfer includes these fields, assume it does and suspend.\n2) SECURE: Use approved transport encryption (TLS 1.2+ for APIs, SFTP/FTPS for file transfers) or implement end\u2011to\u2011end encryption/tokenization before outbound transmission.\n3) NOTIFY: Vendor Management and IT Security must confirm receipt of this notice and provide an initial remediation acknowledgement within 24 hours.\n4) REMEDIATE: Provide a written remediation plan within 48 hours with technical measures, timeline, and testing procedures. Full remediation (encrypted transmission or tokenized data flows) is expected within 7 calendar days unless an exception is authorized by Compliance.\n\nLonger\u2011term controls: Review vendor contracts for data handling obligations, enforce minimum encryption standards, perform quarterly audits of vendor data transfers, and implement automated DLP blocking for outbound PAN/SSN exposures.\n\nPoint of contact: IT Security (it-security@company.com) and Vendor Management (vendor-management@company.com).

This message provides schedule, ordered steps, verification criteria, rollback instructions, and communication protocols. Do NOT share plaintext credentials or DB URIs in chat or email.\n\nScope: Affects service callers that use the production API key and any dependent DB connections. Examples (placeholders only): DB connection string: <DB_URI_REDACTED>, current secret id: <SECRET_ID_REDACTED>.\n\nRotation Window: YYYY-MM-DD, 02:00\u201304:00 UTC (2-hour maintenance window). Adjust only by mutual agreement on secure channel.\n\nPre-rotation checklist (complete before the window):\n- Ensure each team has access to the secrets manager and the appropriate IAM role.\n- Snapshot current secret versions and record secret version IDs in the secret manager audit log.\n- Confirm runbooks and automated smoke tests are up-to-date.\n- Notify SRE and on-call for dependent services.\n\nOrdered Steps (do not paste secrets in messages):\n1) Generate new API key/secret in the approved secrets manager. Tag as rotation-candidate and set a short TTL as applicable.\n2) Deploy to staging: update service configuration to reference the new secret version by secret-manager-path (use the secret manager's reference notation, not the raw value). Run full CI smoke tests and integration tests.\n3) On green in staging, schedule production rollout in the agreed window. Update one production host/pod/instance first (canary) to reference the new secret version.\n4) Monitor canary for 15\u201330 minutes. Check logs, error rates, latency, and health endpoints.\n5) If successful, roll out to remaining instances in controlled batches.\n6) After full rollout and verification, mark the new secret as active and schedule revocation of the old secret per policy (e.g., revoke after 24 hours if no issues).\n\nVerification criteria:\n- No increase in error rate above baseline threshold (e.g., 0.5% or per-team SLA).\n- Health checks return OK across all instances.\n- No authentication failures in logs attributable to the new key.\n- Automated synthetic tests pass.\n\nRollback plan:\n- If the canary fails, revert the canary instance to reference the previous secret version from the secrets manager (use versioned references). Do NOT re-create the old secret value manually.\n- If broad issues occur, pause rollout and escalate to SRE and security. Use the rollback checklist in the rollback_procedure.pdf attachment.\n\nCommunication protocol:\n- Use only approved encrypted channels for all coordination (PGP-encrypted email for formal records, and company-secure-chat for real-time updates). Do NOT paste secrets or DB URIs in chat.\n- Acknowledge steps using this template on the secure channel: \"[TEAM] - STEP X COMPLETED - TIMESTAMP - OK/ISSUE\".\n\nContacts (secure-channel aliases):\n- Lead Developer: dev-lead@company.internal\n- SRE On-call: sre-oncall@company.internal\n- Security Pager: sec-pager@company.internal\n\nPost-rotation tasks:\n- Revoke old key according to policy after confirmation period.\n- Update runbooks and internal wiki with new secret-manager path (not the secret value).\n- Audit logs: ensure rotation events are recorded and reviewed.\n\nSecurity notes:\n- Never transmit raw secrets or DB URIs over email or chat. Use secrets manager references and access controls.\n- If a secret is suspected compromised, trigger emergency rotation and follow incident response procedures.\n\nAttachments: rotation plan, rollback checklist, and verification runbooks are attached for reference.", "recipients": ["dev-team-alpha@company.internal", "dev-team-beta@company.internal", "sre-team@company.internal", "security-team@company.internal"], "attachments": ["api_key_rotation_plan.pdf", "rollback_procedure.pdf", "verification_runbook.pdf"], "links": ["https://internal.company/wiki/api-key-rotation", "https://internal.company/wiki/secrets-management-guidelines"], "_metadata": {"split": "test", "batch_num": 1, "request_index": 349, "agent_type": "security", "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "batch_id": "test_batch_001_openai_gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07"}}
